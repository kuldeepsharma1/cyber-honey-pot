### Honeypot Deployment

To deploy the honeypot system, a minimum of six virtual machines (VMs) or physical machine are required, along with two isolated networks connected through two network switches. Each VM for the PLC controllers and emulators must have two network interfaces: one for the **OT Honeypot Network** and another for the **Orchestration Network**. The network topology is illustrated below:

![](doc/img/um/um_s01.png)

`Figure-01: Honeypot deployment example network topology diagram, version v_0.1.3 (2024)`

The recommended operating system for all VMs is **Ubuntu 22.04**, ensuring compatibility with the honeypot modules and libraries. The deployment should follow the sequence outlined in the table below:

| VM Name                      | Deploy Sequence | Honeypot IP    | Orchestration IP | Program/Module Needed                             |

RPT_INTERVAL:5
```

- Run the controller program with the command: `sudo python3 s7commPlcControllerApp.py`

- Verify that the controller is registered in the monitor hub through the orchestration network. This step is similar to the S7Comm PLC Emulator VM setup.



#### Deploy Ladder Logic In Emulator and Controller

Both the emulator and controller require the same ladder logic module to ensure proper simulation and control. You can use the provided example files, `src\s7commPlcEmulator\s7LadderLogic.py` or `src\modbusPlcEmulator\mbLadderLogic.py`, as templates to create your custom ladder logic.

The ladder logic is implemented using Python, allowing you to simulate complex logic operations. For instance, the following example demonstrates an 8-rung ladder logic that processes the values of 8 input holding registers and updates 8 output coils accordingly.

Ladder logic diagram example:

![](doc/img/um/um_s11.png)

`Figure-10: Honeypot deployment: Test ladder diagram, version v_0.1.3 (2024)`

To simulate the ladder logic in Python, implement the `runLadderLogic()` function in your ladder logic module as shown below:

```python
    #-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    def runLadderLogic(self, regsList, coilList=None):
        """ Execute the ladder logic with the input holding register list and set 
            the output coils. In this example, there will be 8 rungs to be executed.
        """
        # coils will be set ast the reverse state of the input registers' state. 
        if len(regsList) != 8: return None
        # rung 0: HR0 and HR2 -> Q0
        c0 = regsList[0] and regsList[7]
        # rung 1: not HR1 -> Q1
        c1 = not regsList[1]
        # rung 2: HR2 and HR3 and HR4 -> Q2
        c2 = regsList[2] and regsList[3] and regsList[4]
        # rung 3: not HR0 or HR6 -> Q3
        c3 = (not regsList[0]) or regsList[6]
        # rung 4: not (HR4 or HR5) -> Q4
        c4 = not (regsList[4] or regsList[5])
        # rung 5: (not HR0) and HR6 -> Q5
        c5 = (not regsList[0]) and regsList[6]
        # rung 6: HR3 or (not HR7) -> Q6
        c6 = regsList[3] or (not regsList[7])
        # rung 7: HR5 -> Q7
        c7 = regsList[5]
        return [c0, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7]
```

Both the PLC emulator and the controller will use this ladder logic module and call the `runLadderLogic()` function for execution and verification. This ensures consistency between the simulated PLC ladder logic and the control logic in the controller.

### Attack Detection Case Study

This case study demonstrates how to detect and respond to a **Modbus-TCP False Command Injection Attack** using the deployed honeypot system (introduced in the previous section). For details on attack alerts and notifications, refer to the *Alert and Notification* section in the README file.

In this scenario, an attacker attempts to compromise the target PLC in three key steps:

1. **Identify the Target**: Use `Nmap` to scan the network, identify the PLC, and discover open ports.
2. **Modify Access Permissions**: Attempt to read or write data to the PLC and access its configuration page to alter access permissions.
3. **Execute the Attack**: Launch a False Command Injection attack to manipulate PLC coil data by injecting incorrect commands.

The defender detects the attack path and uses the monitor hub’s reports to identify and respond to the attack. The diagram below illustrates the design of the attack scenario with the red team attack path and the blue team detection path: 

![](doc/img/um/um_s12.png)

`Figure-11: Honeypot Attack Detection: attack Path and detection path , version v_0.1.3 (2024)`

#### Attack Step 1: PLC Scanning and Command Attempt

The attacker initiates an **Nmap scan** to probe the target Modbus PLC's IP address(172.23.155.209) , as shown below:

![](doc/img/um/um_s13.png)

`Figure-12: Honeypot Attack Detection: attacker nmap scan result, version v_0.1.3 (2024)`

From the scan, the attacker identifies 2 open ports:

- **TCP Port 502**: Associated with the `mbap` service, indicating a Modbus-TCP server potentially running on a PLC device.
- **TCP Port 5001**: Associated with the `commplex-link` service, possibly hosting an HTTP(S) server.

The attacker performs the following actions:

- Sends `curl` requests to `http://172.23.155.209:5001` and `https://172.23.155.209:5001` to verify the HTTP service response.
- Creates a simple Modbus Read/Write client script to test read and write operations on the PLC:

```python
# A simple modbus IO program, for the lib modbusTcpCom, please refer to this link:
# https://github.com/LiuYuancheng/PLC_and_RTU_Simulator/blob/main/Modbus_PLC_Simulator/src/modbusTcpCom.py
import time
import modbusTcpCom
hostIp = '172.23.155.209'
hostPort = 502
client = modbusTcpCom.modbusTcpClient(hostIp)
print('Try to connect to the target PLC: %s' %str(hostIp))
while not client.checkConn():
    print('Try connect to the PLC')
    print(client.getCoilsBits(0, 4))
    time.sleep(0.5)
# Start the attack
print('Target PLC accept connection request.')
time.sleep(1)
while True:
    print("Inject wrong data...")
    rst1 = client.setCoilsBit(4, False)
    time.sleep(0.2)
    rst2 = client.setCoilsBit(6, True)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    if rst1 is None and rst2 is None: print("injection failed")
```

When running the script, read and write attempts fail because the attacker's IP (`172.23.144.1`) is not in the PLC’s **Allow Read/Write List**, the I/O request are rejected by the PLC.(As shown below)

`Figure-13: Honeypot Attack Detection: Modbus-TCP data read and write script result, version v_0.1.3 (2024)`

>  **Defender Response:** From the blue team side, the defenders check the monitor hub for `ModbusPLC01`'s state page and they can observe Port Touch Warnings for Nmap scans and `curl` actions as shown below:

![](doc/img/um/um_s15.png)

`Figure-14: Honeypot Attack Detection: nmap and curl detection, version v_0.1.3 (2024)`

#### Attack Step 2: Logging into PLC Config Page and Modifying Access Permissions

The attacker accesses the PLC config page at `http://172.23.155.209:5001` using a browser. Upon identifying the device as an M221 PLC, the attacker searches online and finds default login credentials on this link:  https://www.se.com/eg/en/faqs/FAQ000241261/ . 

Using the default admin credentials, the attacker logs in, as shown:

![](doc/img/um/um_s16.png)

`Figure-15: Honeypot Attack: Attacker login the PLC with default credentials, version v_0.1.3 (2024)` 

> **Defender Response:** The blue team observes login activity on the monitor hub. Although this is currently classified as normal, it can be configured to trigger a warning for admin user logins (based on the blue team's config):

![](doc/img/um/um_s17.png)

`Figure-16: Honeypot Attack Detection: Detect the admin user login , version v_0.1.3 (2024)` 

After successful gaining access PLC config interface, the attacker modifies the **Allow Write List**, adding his attack node IP (`172.23.144.1`) as shown below: 

![](doc/img/um/um_s18.png)

`Figure-17: Honeypot Attack: Attacker add the attack node IP in the allow write list, version v_0.1.3 (2024)` 

>  **Defender Response:** From the blue team side, the defender checked the monitor hub's PLC ModbusPLC01's state page, and find that some one is trying to add one unauthorized IP address in the PLC data access and modification list as shown below:

![](doc/img/um/um_s19.png)

`Figure-18: Honeypot Attack Detection: Detect the attacker modified the PLC allow write list , version v_0.1.3 (2024)` 

>  And based on the report, the blue team defender finds the attacker's IP address 172.23.144.1.



#### Attack Step 3: Executing False Command Injection (FCI)

Having modified the access permissions, the attacker reruns the Modbus client script. This time, the PLC accepts the injected coil data, as shown:

![](doc/img/um/um_s20.png)

`Figure-19: Honeypot Attack: attacker run the false command injection attack script , version v_0.1.3 (2024)` 

The attacker also confirms the changes via the PLC state page.

> **Defender Response: **The blue team checks the monitor hub's PLC Controller01's state page and detects unauthorized data modifications in the PLC state page and views detailed alerts on the monitor hub(as shown below):

![](doc/img/um/um_s21.png)

`Figure-20: Honeypot Attack Detection: Detect the PLC output not match the controller's expected result, version v_0.1.3 (2024)` 

> The attack is detected. Now the blue team go to the log archive server web interface to check the controller's latest log:

![](doc/img/um/um_s22.png)

`Figure-21: Honeypot Attack Detection: Check the PLC controller's Log file, version v_0.1.3 (2024)` 

>  By accessing the log archive server, the defender reviews recent logs to identify specific changes made by the attacker. The logs confirm that **Coil 04** was set to `False` and **Coil 06** to `True` as shown below:

![](doc/img/um/um_s23.png)

`Figure-21: Honeypot Attack Detection: Detect injected false command from the Log file, version v_0.1.3 (2024)` 

**Defender Response: Attack Timeline and Path Analysis**

The defender reconstructs the attack timeline based on the alerts and logs, as shown below:

| Time stamp                              | Attack Action                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2024-11-30 9:10:23 am                   | Attack try to scan the PLC-ModbusPLC01(172.23.155.209) ports. |
| 2024-11-30 9:10:23 to 9:14:26           | Attacker try to prob the PLC-ModbusPLC01's http server.      |
| 2024-11-30 9:16:26                      | Attacker access the PLC main landing page from the attack nodes browser |
| 2024-11-30 9:18:06                      | Attacker use the PLC default admin account login to the PLC's configure interface. |
| 2024-11-30 9:18:51                      | Attacker added his attack node's IP 172.23.144.1 in the PLC's allow write list. |
| 2024-11-30 9:23:13                      | Attacker start the attack and try to modified the PLC data.  |
| 2024-11-30 9:23:13 - 2024-11-30 9:56:13 | Attacker keep send the PLC coil data change command to over write coil idx04 to False and coil idx06 to True. |

**Mitigation and Recovery**

- **Access Control Reset**: From the Orchestration Network, the defender disables the attacker’s user account and restores the correct Allow Write List.

- **Alert Escalation**: Configure login attempts by admin accounts as warnings.

- **Log Review**: Continuously monitor logs for unauthorized changes and suspicious activity.
