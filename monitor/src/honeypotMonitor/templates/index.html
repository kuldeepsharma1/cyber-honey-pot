    <p> <b> The Python PLC Honeypot Project is a distributed cybersecurity solution designed to mimic 
            the behavior of real SCADA network control flows between Programable Logic Controllers 
            (PLCs) and Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs), the honey pot is a full digital equivalent 
            VM based system without any special OT-hardware. This system lures potential red team 
            attackers into engaging with a simulated OT (Operational Technology) environment, enabling 
            the collection of attack data, Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) datasets, 
            and supporting the development of enhanced security measures. It also provides a platform 
            for blue team defenders to monitor, analyze, and respond to cyber threats in industrial 
            environments. The system is divided into three main subsystems: </b>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><b> &#149; PLC Emulators Subsystem : </b> The subsystem includes multiple PLC_Emulation_VM to simulate 
          Schneider Modicon M22X (Modbus-TCP) and Siemens S712xx (S7Comm) PLCs, capable of handling OT control 
          requests and executing ladder logic to replicate realistic PLC behaviors.</p>
      <p><b> &#149; PLC Controllers Subsystem : </b> The subsystem includes multiple `PLC_Contoller_VM`s to mimics 
        various control workflows (1-to-1, 1-to-N, and N-to-N HMI-PLC interactions) in OT environments, validating 
        control interactions and reporting verification states to the monitoring system. </p>
      <p><b> &#149; Honeypot Monitor Subsystem: </b> The subsystem includes one `Monitor_Hub_VM` and one Log_Archive_Database_VM 
        to aggregate and process reports from PLC emulators, controllers, and network logs. It provides visualization, 
        alerts, and notifications to defenders via different web based interactive dashboard. </p>
